5. Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
Change deviceName in project (class Driver)
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, DEVICE); // default Android emulator
6. Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests. Are there any difference with run on emulator?
 A pop-up window appears on a real device: select a search engine. In the emulator this window does not appear but it does not interfere with the passing of the test.
For app in appium: 
{
  "platformName": "Android",
  "deviceName": "520064a5b89bc4a9",
  "app": "C:\\Users\\Lika\\NadezhdaPetelimova_Mobile\\src\\main\\resources\\ContactManager.apk"
}

For site:
{
  "platformName": "Android",
  "deviceName": "520064a5b89bc4a9",
	"browserName": "Chrome"
}


And add the necessary Chromedriver.
(for emulator  "deviceName": "emulator-5554")
